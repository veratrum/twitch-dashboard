# twitch-dashboard

This won't allow you to watch streams. It just lists information on currently live streams that you follow.

I personally use [streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) through the command line. I made this so I could avoid using the twitch client entirely. May add more features later but I don't really need anything more than this.
